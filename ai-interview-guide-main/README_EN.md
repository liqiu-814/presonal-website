# AI Engineer Interview Handbook

> A structured interview guide for AI application, RAG, Agent, model training and inference, FDE, multimodal, and AI safety roles.

**662 questions · 28 topics · 7 role-based learning paths**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This page is a translated project introduction. The full question bank and answers are currently maintained in Simplified Chinese. Topic links below open the Chinese content; technical terms and code remain broadly readable.

## Why this repository

- **Built for real roles:** topics follow recurring responsibilities in AI engineering jobs rather than isolated trivia.
- **Engineering trade-offs first:** answers discuss quality, latency, cost, safety, complexity, and alternatives.
- **Quality-controlled:** repository audits check broken links, duplicate questions, unsupported precise metrics, and one-to-one illustration coverage.

## Visual learning

All 28 topics and 662 questions now include a dedicated, clickable 16:9 teaching illustration. The visuals summarize mechanisms, workflows, trade-offs, boundaries, and a retellable memory cue. They currently use Chinese labels, matching the source-of-truth question bank, while standard technical terms remain recognizable.

See the [complete topic catalog in the Chinese README](README.md#catalog).

## How to practice

Prepare three versions of every answer:

1. **30 seconds:** state the decision and the core reasoning.
2. **3 minutes:** explain principles, alternatives, and trade-offs.
3. **Follow-up depth:** explain validation, failure handling, and why you rejected another approach.

Replace all example metrics with evidence from your own work. Product behavior, prices, and benchmark results can change; verify time-sensitive claims against official documentation or original papers.
